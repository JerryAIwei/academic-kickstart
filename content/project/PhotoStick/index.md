The project consists of a tool for making photo books in a fast and user-friendly way, saving
them in a format thatâ€™s size is efficient and easy to share. The photo book is made locally,
neglecting the bandwidth costs and synchronization problems.
The user chooses from his/her gallery which photos to use, and the app will arrange them
according to their proportions in a default book. The user can edit the first result by adding
comments, changing the layouts of the pages, and swapping the photos.
By building an HTML/PDF photo album we make editing and saving easy, and we simplify the
engineering aspect, giving more space to the user experience design.
When the user finished editing, they can save the book locally or upload and share the book in
wechat moments or facebook. Outside our app, the photo book will be opened as a webpage, so
it can be viewed easily.
