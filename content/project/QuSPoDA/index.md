In this project, we constructed a new SLAM system. We used Dual Quadrics(see https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04011) to represent objects in the environment, which are used to optimize the camera track. Then, we used a Nonparametric skill to sovle the data association problem during the construction of Quadrics. We are writing a paper to show more detials.
