[Robomaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) is globe annual robotics competition held by Dji. I joined team Superpower of Tongji as a leader of computer vision group. We won the first prize in the China regional competition and the second prize in the final tournament.   
### Automatic Recognition and Sighting Algorithms  
We optimized the system we designed the previous year to let it detect the target with a higher speed(200 FPS). Then we used Kalman Filter to track and predict the motion of the target to promote the hit rate.

### Power Rune  
We designed algorithms to detect and track the rotating target at 10 meters in order to hit it and gain a power rune.
