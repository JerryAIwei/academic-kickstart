I am a final year undergraduate student in computing engineering at Polimi. My research interests include all aspects of robotics, especially in Semantics SLAM and Robot Vision. I am also interest in Reinforce Learning, Multi-Agent system, One/Few Shot(s) Learning, and Lifelong Learning. My future goal is to advance the Special Intelligent of the robot.   

##I will graduate in 2020 summer. I am looking for an opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. in Robotics.
